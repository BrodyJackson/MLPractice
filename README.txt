	LocusRiskPredictions.py 

		- This is a simple program which looks at a CSV file I created containing imaginary genetic data. The first 8 columns show data for an individual at a certain locus, while the last shows whether they developed cancer or not. The program takes the values from the first 8 columns, and uses them to predict the risk of cancer given an input of patient genetic data.
